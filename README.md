# Advent Of Code 2021

This is all my code that I am using/used for Advent of Code 2021

To get the outputs I just run `make run`

~~Most likely all written in c following the 42 norme, but might switch it up.~~ decided to switch it up on day 2 already.
Languages used so far: C, Python, javascript (Node.js), java, lua, go
